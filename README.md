## 🔧 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI/Gemini API key in .env:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
npm run dev
````

### 🖥 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

* Frontend runs (e.g.) at `http://localhost:5173`
* Backend runs at `http://localhost:5000` (adjust in `.env` or config)

---

## 🧪 Usage

1. Open React UI in browser.
2. Upload a supported document.
3. A `chatId` session is created.
4. Send messages – ChatBot will respond using file context.
5. View/save past chat history.
6. To reset, use the reset endpoint or button if implemented.

---

## 🔗 API Endpoints

* `POST /upload` – Upload a document (multipart/form-data), returns `chatId`
* `POST /chat/:chatId` – Send user message, get AI response
* `GET /history/:chatId` – Fetch chat history for session
* `DELETE /reset/:chatId` – Reset conversation context

*(Adjust path/module names according to your implementation.)*

---

## 📄 File Upload Instructions

* Supported types: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`, `.html`
* Max size: (specify, e.g., 5 MB)
* UI allows selecting file and triggering upload
* Uploaded content is processed by backend and embedded for context
